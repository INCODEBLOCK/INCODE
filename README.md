The first native decentralized mixer on Solana.

TORMIX is the first native decentralized mixer on Solana — a system that reconstructs privacy through the union of cryptography and speed.

Built on zero-knowledge proofs and stealth address architecture, it employs multi-layered mixing and randomization to make every transaction verifiable on-chain while completely breaking traceability.

When a user deposits funds into the mixing pool, the system automatically splits them into encrypted fragments, introducing randomized delays and multi-path routing along the timeline.
These fragments are rehashed, reshuffled, and anonymized by the mixing engine, generating a set of output proofs entirely detached from their original inputs.
When the user withdraws, only a zero-knowledge proof is required to verify legitimacy — no source or linkage is ever revealed.

The entire process is trustless and intermediary-free, executed fully by on-chain smart contracts and cryptographic validation.
Leveraging Solana’s high throughput and low latency, TORMIX compresses the traditionally complex process of mixing into seconds, achieving privacy without sacrificing efficiency.

It is not an app or an external bridge, but a privacy layer embedded directly into the chain itself.

Within Solana’s transparent and high-speed ledger, TORMIX redefines what anonymity means — where privacy is reborn in speed, and trust endures in code.
